# EOG-to-Servo-Motor

Connect horizontal lead to pin A0 of the Arduino
Provide Arduino with -2.5V offset voltage to ground for proper Analog to Digital conversion
Connect Servo motor to 5V power input and GND of the Arduino
Connect signal pin of servo to Digital Pin 3 of the Arduino
Upload BENG_152_Eye_Tracking.ino sketch to Arduino

Make sure color.m is downloaded and in path for MATLAB
color.m creates a grid with the specified box highlighted as directed in the BENG 152 Final Project Eye Tracking.m code

For the BENG 152 Final Project Eye Tracking.m code:
  Connect Arduino to MATLAB
  Run the calibration section and follow directions as prompted in the command window
  Run 'Eye Tracking' Trial section to control movement of highlighted grid
